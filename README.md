# How to setup Mica For Everyone

- 1.) Get [Mica For Everyone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone) (Required for the glass effect) and your client mod of choice
- 2.) Once installed set to run on startup (this is to ensure discord always looks crisp and pretty)
- 3.) In the bottom left, press the plus icon and type "discord" into the box (this is how it knows to apply the effect to discord)
- 4.) Set the backdrop type to either acrylic or mica (Acrylic looks best if you want a clear and semi glassy background and Mica does a great privacy glass feel)
- 5.) Although optional you can change window rounding (the little bits on the corner)

NOTE: Do not touch "Blur behind" or "Extend into client area", those are not needed for this

## Additional Notes:

This is not my theme, this is simply a modification to it so that it works on newer versions of discord. I will try and maintain this for as long as I possibly can!
